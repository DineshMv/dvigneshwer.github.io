This event happened at AIT, Pune and was one of the early TS-MozillaReps coordinated MozActivate Rust event where I gave a 1 hour talk about Rust Lang and its features followed by Q&A. 

Highlights
==========

Delivered a remote session on Rust Language to the members of AIT Mozilla club.

* There were around 60+ participants
* Covered all the major aspects of the Rust language
* Shared all the details about how to get started with Rust Community
* Mentioned the active projects build using Rust

Demystifying Rust @AIT
======================

Among all my live remote sessions, this was the largest one in terms of participation. Initially there was some connectivity problems but we some how managed to overcome the hurdles and went ahead with the talk. The pdf version of my slides are available at the Resources section below.
