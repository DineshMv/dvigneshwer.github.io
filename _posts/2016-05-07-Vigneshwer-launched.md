Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 

It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Will be blogging about various projects and how to implement in the most easiest matter.

Project Keywords : Sensors, Data Analytics, IOT, Realtime problem solving, Algorithms.
