<h2>Introduciton to GIT</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Git help in version control, earlier when a devloper adds a new feature to existing codebase the changes made in the file system was not correclty managed, with help of git we can basically get the snaphots of all the file system changes.
<br><br>
On of the best reference I have come across is <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" >http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ </a>
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Introduciton to Shell scripting</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Shell scripting is really fun, it automize's your work and makes functionality so easy. It comes really handy when you want to correlate lots of your modules.

<h2>DOCKER </h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Docker is the world's leading software containerization platform.Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>CONTAINERS</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Containers include the application and all of its dependencies but share the kernel with other containers.Running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system.<br>
Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>ADVANTAGES OF DOCKER</h2>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Accelerates development</li>
<li>Eliminate environment inconsistency</li>
<li>Deployment becomes easy</li>
<li>Quickly scale</li>
</ul>
