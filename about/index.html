	<h1>About me</h1>
   	As I mentioned in my main page, this space is strictly maintained for publishing the opensource projects I am involved with.<br>

   	I work on these projects in my free time, the motivation is to give back to the communities which helped me kick start with these technologies and I find this place very cozy to document all of my works <br>

   	By profession I am researcher in an analytics firm primarily working on IOT and video analytics.

   	<br>
   	I am Mozilla Rep in Tamil Nadu region, help budding mozillians and FSA to get kick started with Mozilla initiatives and community. 

   	<br>
   	Below are my social channels in case you want to reach me out.
